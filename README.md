# The Odin Project - Web Development #
## Project: Rock Paper Scissors ##
The second project of TOP is a console based rock paper scissors game. This game
is implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I added the basic layout of GUI since
later in this curriculum I will revisit this project to add GUI based functionality.

### What I've learned from this project: ###
* How to manually add files to github and pull them to my local repository using git
* Basic Javascript syntax (I already know Java so this wasn't a huge leap)
* How to add external Javascript to HTML file
* Text color animations using CSS
